Description: Free fonts with the same metrics as Times, Arial and Courier
 A set of serif, sans-serif and monospaced fonts from Red Hat with exactly
 the same metrics as the (non-free) Microsoft Times, Arial and Courier
 fonts, which implies those fonts can serve as a drop-in replacement. The
 font family is named Liberation.
